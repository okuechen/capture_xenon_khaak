# X4: Foundations - Capture Xenon and Khaak S / M Ships

This mod enables capturing xenon and khaak ships. AI's cannot eject, but they can be damaged during a fight. With this mod, this might happen with a 50% chance of standard bailing. No ships are actually changed, so those ships still have no docking port or cockpit. You won't be able to enter it. Because of that, xenon and khaak ships will change to your faction instead of being factionless right after the "bailing" process.
